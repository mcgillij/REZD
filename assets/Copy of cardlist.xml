        <text>-> If you pay [2], Runner is now encountering the outermost piece of rezzed ice on a datafort of your choice, instead of passing Vortext. The run is now considered to be a run on that data fort. If there is no rezzed ice on that fort, Runner is considered to have passed that last piece of ice on that fort.</text>
